        <h3 style="text-align:center">Goals for Network Security:</h3>
        <p>
            1. Create a network infrastructure design communications document that includes identified hardware components, connections to outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media) and addressing, including operational and security components in the design.
            <br><br>
            2.  Install, configure, and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation such as port scanners, vulnerability detection systems, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, system hardening, anti-virus tools, patch management, auditing, and assessment.
            <br><br>
            3.  Construct, implement and document a script or a program to automate a security-related process or other tasks such as installation, administration, management, mapping resources, logon scripts, patch management, updates, auditing, analysis, and assessment.
            <br><br>
            4.  Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as: a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan, an incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical security policy, assessments or troubleshooting procedures.
            <br><br>
            5.  Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements that pertain to information security.
            <br><br>
            6.  Research, document, test and evaluate several current industry information security-based threats, risks, malicious activities, covert methodology, encryption technologies, mitigation techniques or unconventional tactics to prevent loss of sensitive information and data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.<br><br>
